https://www.acestudentprograms.com/register/logon.php When you choose ‚ÄúManage Convention
Registrations‚Äù choose the proper convention: CANADA ‚Äì 2024 Maritime RSC. Proceed with
registration as you did in previous years. (Click the help tab at the top of the page as needed.)
Note that when adding entries, the Junior events appear after Senior events. Make sure you
register Juniors for events with ‚ÄúJr‚Äù in the entry name. (The only exception is when a Jr and Sr are
in an event together. Example: If they are in duet together, enter both in the Sr. event.) The
computer will NOT correct mistakes. The Junior Judge‚Äôs Forms will not print automatically. Please
print blank forms for Juniors from the ACE Canada guidelines and photocopy as needed. GUIDELINES & EVENTS: Guidelines specific to Maritime convention are found online at:
http://www.acecanada.net/pdf's/Jr%20Student%20Convention%20Guidelines.pdf Be sure to
refer to the Maritime section which starts at approx. page 24.
You can also find the Junior guidelines and events for ages 7 to 12 at the above location. When
they differ from the general guidelines, ALWAYS go by the Maritime guidelines.
Please find the list of Senior Events in the International Student Convention guidelines at
Convention Guidelines | A.C.E. School of Tomorrow (aceschooloftomorrow.com) We will not be offering:
table tennis, tennis, volleyball, basketball, archery.
We plan to have some open events and games that students may sign up for when they arrive.
Things to note for 2024:
1. Checkers and Chess (and any other elimination events) may be limited to six entries per
school. This may differ from the guidelines which often only allow 3.
2. Track events may be run in the back parking lot on gravel, hard dirt, etc.
3. Early Entries are not accommodated.
4. Supper on Day 2 (Tuesday) is not provided.
5. Due to the small size of our convention, some events may be combined into categories for
judging when there are only one or two entries in the event and the judges are the same. For
example if there are only 3 science exhibits and they are all in different events (collection,
research, engineering, etc.), each entry will be judged with the proper form, and the highest
score will be 1st in the Science Exhibits category, next highest score will be 2nd, etc. This is
how events will be combined for category judging: Science and Social Studies Exhibits,
Creative Composition, Computer Programs, Brush Art (Oil, Watercolor, Acrylics), Drawing Art
(Sketching, Pen & Ink, Colored Pencils, Pastels), Woodworking, Monochromatic Photography,
Colour Photography, Sewing, Needlework (Cross-stitch, Embroidery), Knitting & Crochet,
Quilts & Afghans, Male & Female & Mixed Events in Vocals, Male & Female in Platform.
Remember only events (having the same judges) with just 1 or 2 entries will be combined and
judged as categories.
6. There are a few new events. Check the guidelines for details.
Students continuing to ISC who had no competitors in their event and did not place 1st, 2nd, or 3rd
in the broader category may still take their event to I.S.C. as a top three placing.

love to have you join us ‚Äì to compete or observe. Come and be encouraged,
meet some new friends, and join in the fun. You‚Äôll be glad you did!</p>
